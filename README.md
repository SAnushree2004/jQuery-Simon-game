# 🎮 Simon Game

Welcome to my first jQuery project – **Simon Game**!  
It's a fun memory-based color sequence game that tests how well you can remember and repeat an ever-growing pattern.

## 🚀 About the Project

This game was built using:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **jQuery**

Through this project, I learned about DOM manipulation, animations, and event handling using jQuery.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A color will flash – repeat the sequence by clicking the colors in order.
3. Each round adds a new color to the sequence.
4. If you make a mistake, the game is over and you can restart!
